#### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is George. Welcome to my Github profile page. I'm a Full Stack Developer, having made a dramatic career switch after almost a decade in the Banking Industry. 

#### I find Software Development exciting and suiting my natural ability. I love to travel and I love football. When I'm not coding, I write tech-based articles on codedli.com, medium.com, and Dev to.

#### I'm a Nigerian living in the diaspora and also a Digital Nomad. I hope to have visited 20 countries by 2025.
